### Flux Capacitor

### Pitch

A mapping/routing tool that helps users find alternative fuel
stations within a distance of a driving route. The map will email
you a link to your navigation page that you can open on your cell phone
and allow you to navigate from your current position.  Users can save
future trips or mark them completed.  Users might also be able to upload
pictures from their trip and upload them as a Facebook album.

### Problem

Often times electric car owners are afraid to drive too far from their
homes/favorite charging stations because they don't want to run out of
juice.  

### Solution

Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's API, Mapbox, Leaflet,
Geocoder and Facebook, I'll be able create an application where users
can plan trips, finding charging stations along their route, save that
trip and open it from their cell phone, by clicking on an email generated
by my site.  If I have time, I'd also like users to save pictures from their
trips to my site and upload them into Facebook as an album.

### Target Audience

This app will be useful for adventurous, environmentally conscious, tech
savvy folks looking for a fun weekend adventure.
